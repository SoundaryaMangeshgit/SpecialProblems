# SpecialProblems Course

The following project has three parts

1. Docker part, which streams the Tweets and stores them into mysql database and running these microservices in docker.


2. Node js
3. React js

The user enters the tweets in react js 
The tweet text is sent , through axios post to node js part. 
The tweet text is searched in stored tweets in Mysql. 
The results are displayed in react js page, which are tweets stored and displayed. 

Twitter Visualization:

I have used the following technologies to perform twitter analysis and sentiment analysis:

1. Node
2. Express
3. Socket.IO
4. D3.js
5. Twitter API
6. Babel

When user enters the keyword twitter streaming API listens to it and sends tweets which are performed
sentiment analysis and the object is sent it to client. 
Using socket.io and Node js, real time tweets are displayed on the react js page 
which serves as the view here. 
Using D3.js , the react component is rendered into a graph.

Using LinePaths.jsx and DataPoints.jsx the graphs is plotted.
